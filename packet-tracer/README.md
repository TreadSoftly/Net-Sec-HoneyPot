# Packet Tracer Labs

## What It Covers

- Cisco IOS routing, VLAN segmentation, ACLs, AAA.
- Visualizing NetFlow/IPFIX exporters and syslog forwarding paths before replicating in the full lab.
- Practicing change management steps prior to applying them on pfSense.

## What It Does Not Cover

- No Windows, Ubuntu, or pfSense emulation.
- No containerized services or honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea, DVWA).
- Limited IDS/IPS functionality; use real lab for Suricata and Wazuh integration.

## How It Helps

- Build intuition for routing and firewall policies before editing production lab configs.
- Test failover scenarios rapidly without impacting real VMs.
- Supplement interview storytelling with topology diagrams exported from Packet Tracer.

Place `.pkt` files under `packet-tracer/labs/`. Use `docs/evidence/` to describe outcomes when relevant.
